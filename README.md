# naive-bayes-20newsgroup-classification
A simple application of Naive Bayes and Maximum Likelihood classifier on 20 news group data.

## This project essentially does the following:
1. Train Naive Bayes(BE) and Maximum Likelihood estimation(MLE) model from the training data under 20newsgroup.
2. Use both the train models to predict the newsgroup for each documents in test data.
3. Finally, the accuracies of train data BE, test data BE and test data MLE is computed along with priors and Confusion matrix.
